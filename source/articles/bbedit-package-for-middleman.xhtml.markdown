I’m always guilty of underusing BBEdit and since it’s my text editor of choice and Middleman is my website development tool of choice I’ve made a modest effort to improve the way I use the two together.

I’ve put this package on GitHub ([FearGoidte/Middleman.bbpackage](https://github.com/FearGoidte/Middleman.bbpackage)) in the hope that it might prove of use to someone or even more than one. If you do find this useful, and you expand upon it, please create a fork and create a pull request if you want me to incorporate your improvements into my version.

This package is a work in progress, it includes a few useful [clippings](http://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/clippings_library.html) (more to come); scripts to launch the preview server and open the site in the default browser, build the site, and using [middleman-deploy](https://github.com/middleman-contrib/middleman-deploy) to deploy it to a server.
